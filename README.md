# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
A simple analysis to tidy the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files
* `run_analysis.R` - R script that merges, extracts, labels, and summarizes the data
* `run_analysis_summary.txt` - Output txtfile generated by `run_analysis.R`
* `CodeBook.md` - Description of the variables, the data, and the work performed to clean up and summarize the data
* `README.md` - Current file

### Getting started
1. Download [experiment data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
2. Refer to [CodeBook]() for information on experiment data and project workflow
3. Run `run_analysis.R`
